MC: I rush over to the segment with the sword and grab it.

MC: It is an ordinary iron sword without anything remarkable about it.

MC: I turn towards the golem and take a stand.

Nat: The golem is approaching $Name and slows down in front of him. It then punches $Name.

Nat: $Name evades to the side of the arm and tries to cut off the arm with the sword.
