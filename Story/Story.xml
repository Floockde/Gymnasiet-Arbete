                    MC: I'm lost...

                    MC: I was trying to foraging some herbs and medicine for my village... (not drugs)

                    MC: I found some of the herbs, but then I was too into the foraging that I wasn't paying attention to my surrounding...

                    MC: ...

                    Nat: Some time go by while $name is walking around.

                    MC: This isn't working. I'm gonna have to think harder.

                    MC: Let's try again.</p>
